📘 Learning-JS

🚀 Learning-JS is a structured and progressive JavaScript learning repository documenting my journey from core fundamentals to advanced DOM-based builds and mini-projects.

This repository is organized by learning phases: Core concepts, DOM manipulation, advanced implementations, practice problems, and revision modules.

🧠 1️⃣ CoreJS – JavaScript Fundamentals

This folder covers foundational concepts:

Variables & Data Types

Operators

Control Flow (if-else, switch)

Loops

Functions

Arrays

Objects

Basic script execution

Files include:

data_types.js

operators.js

control_flow.js

loops.js

functions.js

arrays.js

objects.js

This section builds the core logic foundation.

🌐 2️⃣ DOM – Document Object Model

This is the most extensive part of the repository.

It includes:

🔹 Basic DOM Concepts

Attribute manipulation

Text access

Class & style manipulation

Event handling

Dynamic DOM updates

🔹 Window Events

Scroll

Resize

Load events

🔹 Timers

setTimeout

setInterval

🔹 Local Storage

Storing and retrieving data from browser storage

🔹 Form Handling & Validation

Email/password validation

Form validation logic

🔹 23 Progressive Builds

The Build1 to Build23 folders represent progressive DOM-based mini implementations including:

UI interaction experiments

Dynamic components

Event-based logic

Styling integration

Image-based builds

Validation systems

Each build contains:

index.html

script.js / index.js

style.css (where applicable)

This section reflects practical learning and real DOM manipulation practice.

⚡ 3️⃣ AdvanceJS

Contains advanced feature-based implementations.

🔔 Toaster Component

Located in:

AdvanceJS/toaster/

Includes:

Custom notification logic

Position-based UI rendering

Dynamic class handling

Event-driven behavior

🧩 4️⃣ Practice

Focused on logic-building and real-world exercises:

BMI Calculator

Discount Calculator

Object practice

Function practice

Form practice

General JavaScript problem-solving

This section strengthens algorithmic thinking.

🔁 5️⃣ Revision

Contains recap files to reinforce previously learned concepts.

Used for:

Rewriting concepts from memory

Practicing fundamentals again

Strengthening retention

🎯 Skills Covered

This repository demonstrates practical understanding of:

JavaScript fundamentals

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Dynamic UI logic

Form validation

Local storage

Timers & asynchronous behavior

Component-based thinking

🛠 How to Run
▶ Run CoreJS or Practice Files with Node:
node CoreJS/arrays.js

▶ Run DOM / Builds:

Open the respective index.html file in a browser.

🎥 Learning Source

This learning journey was guided by tutorials from Sheryians Coding School on YouTube.

Their structured teaching approach helped in building this organized learning repository.

📈 Future Plans

ES6+ deep dive

Promises & Async/Await
